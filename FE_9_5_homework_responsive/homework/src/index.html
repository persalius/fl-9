                        <p>In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>

                        <p>There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitation pull that the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon,. The bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotqates, causing high and low tides around the globe.</p>

                        <p>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.</p>

                        <p>The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on Earth. Thisis why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound so high in the air.</p>

                        <p>These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar astronauts used seismograhhs on their visits to the Moon, and found that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the surface. causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten core, just like Earth.</p>
